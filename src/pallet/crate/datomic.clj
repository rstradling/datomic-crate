;; A Clojure library designed to work with pallet 0.8.0 and create a
;; datomic instance.  This instance has been tested on Ubuntu and RHEL with the
;; free version of datomic.  I hope that this works with non-free
;; versions as well but I don't know that process.  Pull requests are
;; welcome. It is expected that you have installed Java in order for
;; the service to start correctly.   This crate will
;; * Download datomic based upon the type and version
;; * Unzip datomic into /opt/local/datomic/<version>
;; * Update a soft lknk /opt/local/datomic/current ->
;;                                  /opt/local/datomic/version
;; * Install the upstart service (IT DOES NOT RUN THE SERVICE)
